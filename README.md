# Taiwanese  Panel Study Family Dynamics (English Codebook)
coding procedures for creating English version of PSFD with a codebook

This folder contains Stata .do files to create a 2007-2016 PSFD dataset containing English labels.
As the base, I use 2007 file. All other files are appended to 2007 PSFD.

I also attached a .csv codebook which contains the information about the resulting variables and the original variables from each cycle of PSFD.
